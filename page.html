    <p>My name is Kashmyrr Ryuveniz M. Deano and I am 15 years old. I love writing about fanfiction, and creating headcanons. I also love talking to friends on tumblr, singing and other things online with some of my friends. I have three dogs, and I love them so much more than my family. Also I love learning about the history of the world, hoping to become a criminologist when I'm grown. Okay, I hope you all have a good day and enjoy po</p>
